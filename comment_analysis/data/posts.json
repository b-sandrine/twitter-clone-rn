        "content": "The US Department of Education has stopped accepting applications for all income-driven repayment (IDR) plans for federal student loans. This decision follows a court ruling that expanded an injunction against the Biden administration's SAVE plan, which was designed to adjust payments based on borrowers' income and family size.\n\nIDR plans, including Income-Based Repayment, Income-Contingent Repayment, Pay As You Earn, and the SAVE plan, help borrowers manage payments and offer loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years. The suspension comes amid staffing shortages, technical challenges, and broader policy changes affecting the Department.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",
