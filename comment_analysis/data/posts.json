        "content": "Mike White, the mastermind behind “The White Lotus,” had even more to pack into the just-concluded third season, but he says some juicy things had to be cut from the 90-minute finale.\n\nIn the companion podcast to the buzzy series, White – the show’s creator, writer, director and executive producer – revealed that Piper’s (Sarah Catherine Hook) story had to be thinned considerably, including a fling she has with Zion (Nicholas Duvernay), which White said was “very disappointing.”\n\nWhite said the sequence would have added 10 minutes to the finale and tonally felt like a mismatch to have “a rom-com vibe in the middle of trying to kill the family with the pong pong fruits.”",
